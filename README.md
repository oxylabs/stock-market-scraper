### How it works

You can get Stock-Market results by providing your own URLs to our service. We can return the HTML for any Stock-Market page you like.

#### Python code example

The example below illustrates how you can get HTML of Stock-Market page.

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
    'source': 'universal',
    'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ym%3df?p=ym%3df'
}

# Get response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('user', 'pass1'),
    json=payload,
)

# Instead of response with job status and results url, this will return the
# JSON response with the result.
pprint(response.json())
```
